<!--
  This test verifies that when Feature-Policy "lazyload" is enabled, the "lazyload"
  attribute value of "off" turns off lazy loading (i.e., the expected behavior
  from the attribute). This is verified by comparing this page with the reference
  page in which the "lazyload" attribute for the image is set to "on".
